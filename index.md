## Academic History

Upon entering high school, I really had no idea what I wanted to do for a career. Obviously, every kid wants to be a doctor or a fire fighter, but I quickly realized those dreams were not what I wanted to do for a career. During my sophomore year in high school, I enrolled in a culinary class and considered pursuing a career in culinary arts. However, after taking more classes such as Foods 1 to 3, having the opportunity to enter into my high schools’ culinary program and receiving a recommendation by my Foods teacher, this brought me to the realization that I enjoyed cooking as more of a hobby than a career. As I entered college, I still was unsure of what I wanted to do for a career, but as a kid and even now, I have always loved math. Math was my strongest subject in school and to this day is something that I just enjoy. Therefore, I decided to pursue that as a career and become a mathematician. Again, after a few classes in college, I realized that even though I love math it is not something I want to deal with on a day-to-day basis.  However, along with being enrolled in my community colleges math program, I was enrolled into Intro to Programming. After that course, my love for computer science and computer programming really peaked my interest. I realized that it was something that I truly enjoyed by thinking about how to lay out a program or just simply listening to my teacher talk about programming and learning something new every lecture. I knew I had found my passion and I have remained hooked ever since. Thus leading me into computer science and my decision to choose a career path in this field. Firstly, I am an avid gamer, love video games and everything about them.  I have even considered wanting to try to create them. While taking a game development class, I slowly realized even though I love everything about video games creating and designing them just was not for me. It did however make me realize that it was not a path I wanted to follow, but I still was passionate about programming. So, I continued down that path of taking programming class after programming class honing my craft and skill as a programmer.
