## ABOUT ME

Thank you for visiting my ePortfolio!

Computer Science has been something that I have always been interested in, my mom has worked for a software developer for twenty-eight years. From sitting on her lap while she would talk to her colleagues about their best approach to keeping companies under license to providing executives with feedback from the customer.  So, computers and software was something that I have been around from a young age I was one of the first kids in my neighbor to have my own computer because my mom didn’t want me to use her so she could work in peace. I remember my friends coming over to play the newest PC games as well as use our internet because again we were one of the first to not have dial up internet.

Currently, I am senior majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering at Southern New Hampshire University. I grew up in Aurora, Illinois and graduated from West Aurora High School in May 2010. After West Aurora, I proceeded to go to Waubonsee Community in the Fall of 2010 to pursue my associate degree in Mathematics. I was forced to take a step back from my degree to take care of my parents, but it allowed me the opportunity to think about my career and what I wanted to pursue, which brought me to realizing that computers were my true passion and were something that I wanted to pursue, so in fall 2014 I began retaking courses at a reduced rate at Waubonsee Community College to pursue my degree in Computer Science. In the Fall of 2018 I committed to that dream and enrolled at Southern New Hampshire University.

## CAREER GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

Firstly, for my career I want to complete my bachelor’s in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University. As well as any other certificates or education that will help improve my skills as a programmer. From there I want to use those skills and knowledge that I have learned and apply them at a company that I feel passionate about and can really get behind the product they are creating. I want to create something that makes a difference and helps people in their daily lives.

Now for my future goals, I want to be a Chief Technology Officer or Head of Engineering for top software engineering company. I also want to be apart of a project that will change peoples lives and the software or product will be something that everyone uses.
